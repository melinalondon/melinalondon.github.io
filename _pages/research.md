## Cross-Sector Interactions in Western Europe: Lessons From Trade Credit Data ##

Large-scale analyses to map existing interactions between financial constraints at the sectoral level are still scarce. To fill the gap, this paper identifies short–term predictive relationships between sectors' financial health thanks to the construction of an original micro-based indicator. Using defaults on trade credit as a sign of tighter financial constraint and a high-dimensional VAR model, I test for Granger non-causality and identify predictive relationships across sectors. Past tightening in a sector's financial constraint is shown to be predictive of a narrower budget constraint in other sectors after controlling for macroeconomic determinants. These interactions, both in their existence and magnitude, follow the pattern of input--output network. Such structure of interactions is in line with shock propagation mechanisms described in the literature, both for direct propagation through supplier-buyer input-output relationship but also for indirect one among two suppliers of substituable goods. A few sectors - among which construction, wholesale and retail, and motor vehicles - tend to display a wider set of predictive relationships, making them key to track in monitoring processes.

## Trade Networks and Natural Disasters ##

With Timothée Gigout.

We study how trade networks react to large natural disasters. We combine exhaustive trade credit and disaster data and use a dynamic differences-in-differences identification strategy to establish the causal effect of natural disasters on the size and shape of international trade networks. We find strong and permanent negative effects on the trade credit exposure of French exporters. This effect is explained by a decrease in the amount requested by suppliers rather than the amount granted by the insurer. Additionally, we find no evidence of increased default rates among buyers.
