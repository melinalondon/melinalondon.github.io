## Cross-Sector Interactions in Western Europe: Lessons From Trade Credit Data##

Besides an increasing focus on production interdependencies along supply chains, little is known about how firms' financial health interact across sectors and how it relates to production patterns. To fill the gap, this study uses an original database from one of the top three credit insurers in the world to study sectors' financial state through the lenses of trade credits without requiring proxies. It measures financial health in each sector using data on trade credit defaults between 2007 and 2019. Using a two-step high-dimensional method involving repeated lasso selections, this article identifies predictive relationships across sectors that hold outside of a common exposure to macroeconomic dynamics. A few sectors -- among which construction, wholesale and retail, and motor vehicles -- tend to display a wider set of predictive relationships towards other sectors than the average, making them key to track in monitoring processes. The existence of these predictive relationships, as well as their magnitude, is positively and significantly related to the amount of intermediate goods owing from one sector to the other. Such result is consistent with sector-level shock propagation patterns working through production links such as highlighted in the production network literature.

## Trade Networks and Natural Disasters ##

With Timoth√©e Gigout.

We study how trade networks react to large natural disasters. We combine exhaustive trade credit and disaster data and use a dynamic differences-in-differences identification strategy to establish the causal effect of natural disasters on the size and shape of international trade networks. We find strong and permanent negative effects on the trade credit exposure of French exporters. This effect is explained by a decrease in the amount requested by suppliers rather than the amount granted by the insurer. Additionally, we find no evidence of increased default rates among buyers.
